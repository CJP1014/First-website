    <h2>Beginning Writing Routine</h2>
    Another productive way to use this tool to begin a daily writing routine. <br>One way is to generate a random paragraph with the intention to try to rewrite it while still keeping the original meaning. <br>The purpose here is to just get the writing started so that when the writer goes onto their day's writing projects, words are already flowing from their fingers.<br><br><br>
